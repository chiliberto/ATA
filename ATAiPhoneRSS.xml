Itâ€™s a film about the American South, where rock was born. Itâ€™s about a band, straddling the borders of rock, punk, and country. Itâ€™s about making art, making love and making a living. Itâ€™s about the Drive-By Truckers. â€œThe Secret to a Happy Endingâ€ documents the band and their congregation of fans as they explore tales of human weakness and redemption. While DBT songs are often dark, their whiskey-soaked concerts raise joyful hell. With the filmmakerâ€™s unparalleled access, â€œThe Secret to a Happy Endingâ€ documents three critical years of touring and recording â€“ years in which the band struggles to overcome the trauma of divorce and survives a near breakup, as they persist in their search for a happy ending.

In February 2004 independent filmmaker Barr Weissman proposed making the documentary. After several discussions with the band, filming began in January 2005 and wrapped up in October 2007. Following a long twisted road, editing was completed in November 2009. TRT 101 mins, Q&amp;A with director Barr Weissman following the screening.

She works out of her century-old house removing clients’ aches and pains, advising gamblers and channeling cranky spirits for a quick check-in with their loved ones. Zel is very good at her chosen profession, but she also receives some unique assistance. For as long as she can remember she has shared her home with a group of ghosts — a priest, a bride, a mute child, some washed up vaudevillians and a noisy group of sight-impaired musicians — who pass on incredible knowledge and abilities from beyond the world of the

living.

All goes on at the family homestead as it has for generations, until a mysterious light appears in the woods. The ghosts suddenly realize they are trapped and forge a rebellion, tormenting Zel with all the aggravation and insanity they can muster. When Zel uncovers the origins of these spirits, she is forced to choose between her comfortable if strange existence and letting go of the only family she has ever known.

Zel’s unique story is a lesson in hope, habit, and folklore. The atmosphere is utterly enchanting, an odd realism tinged with humor and wonder. Angela Bettis, respected cult actress known for roles in MAY and GIRL, INTERRUPTED delivered an extraordinary performance as Zel. Superstition, sound and the intricate details of the claustrophobic house feed the film’s construction, allowing the story to unfold like music. This is no surprise, as writer/director Tim Rutili is also a founding member of the band Califone, who appear in the film and provide the lush original soundtrack.
